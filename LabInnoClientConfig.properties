message=When the integrated OpenShift Docker Registry receives a new image, it creates and sends an ImageStreamMapping to OpenShift. This informs OpenShift of the imageâ€™s namespace, name, tag, and Docker metadata. OpenShift uses this information to create a new image (if it does not already exist) and to tag the image into the image stream. OpenShift stores complete metadata about each image (e.g., command, entrypoint, environment variables, etc.). Note that images in OpenShift are immutable. Also, note that the maximum name length is 63 characters.
